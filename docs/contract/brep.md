# The Rust B-rep kernel

Part of the [contract](../../CLAUDE.md) the code is held to. Read it when you touch `brep/`. An
issue number (#n) or a spec version ([0.n], see the [language changelog](../solvent-changelog.md))
says where a rule came from.

**The Rust B-rep kernel** ([plan](../rust-kernel-plan.md)); clean-room — OCCT is LGPL, this repo
MIT: its code is never translated, only its behaviour and conventions studied. `gcs_core::brep`:
`geom` (surfaces parameterised as OCCT/STEP do, closed-form inverses, signed distances, `Traced`
intersections), `topo` (`Brep`: oriented uses with pcurves, degenerate poles; `check`, `pinches`),
`build` (prisms, revolutions, lofts of line/arc/circle/spline profiles), `props` (volume by Green's
theorem), `query`, `ssi` (closed forms, else traced), `boolean` (split, arrange, classify,
assemble), `mesh` (constrained Delaunay refined to a measured sag), `step` (AP214 with pcurves and
seam curves), `recipe`. A traced pair is seeded where edges cross faces; between analytic
surfaces `ssi::unseen` then searches one face for curves no edge reaches (cells proved clear by
the signed distance's Lipschitz and second-order bounds, else beside a known curve, else seeded),
refusing what it cannot resolve: an untraced meeting is never read as none (issue #58).
`Brep::bounds` encloses (issue #59; `through:` cutters, tool culls): `Curve::bounds` exact for
lines and conics, the poles reaching a B-spline's range, a trace by its measured sagitta; a face bulges
past its edges only off a `ruled` surface (`Surface::bounds_over`: meridians at each axis's
extreme angle). Never a sample grid: extremes between samples were missed.
**This kernel is every export's default** (phase 5): OCCT answers only `--kernel occt` /
`--stl-backend occt` / `SOLVENT_KERNEL=occt` (the oracle; refused in a build without OCCT), its
STEP checked by `step_check` against `Solid::of`. `gcs-cli tests/brep_oracle.rs` builds every
corpus recipe node both ways (where OCCT is off the bar a closed form or OCCT's own declaration
decides: a whole revolution of lines and arcs is held to Pappus, `pappus`; a Boolean whose edges
OCCT declares far coarser than its operands' — two tori touching in the hypoid's tooth space — to
that tolerance times its area, ours rebuilt at tolerances ten times either way within 1e-9,
`rebuilt`; a general surface OCCT builds for an analytic one of ours must lie on ours within its
declared face tolerance); `tests/brep_census.rs` holds a census and `brep_body_debug`;
`SOLVENT_BREP_DEBUG` narrates, `SOLVENT_BREP_TIME` times slow Boolean steps. OCCT's volume of a
STEP it reads (~1e-5) is no gate on our accuracy. Rung 1 is done: every corpus solid with a recipe
agrees with OCCT (volume 1e-9, faces by kind) but for named refusals of self-touching designs
(surfaces meeting under 1°, pinches).
**Phase 1 (OCCT's shape, our files):** `SOLVENT_WRITER=rust` reads OCCT's solid into `brep`
(`backend/dump.cpp` → `Session::brep_json` → `brep::json::read`; uses ordered by vertex and
parameters since OCCT's wire explorer misreads a closed edge) and writes STEP/STL by ours.
`Surface::BSpline` is a `nurbs::Net`, **rational where it carries weights** (`BSpline`/`Net`
`weights: Option<…>`, finite and positive; `None` divides nothing, so polynomial exports keep their
bytes; `nurbs::arc` is a circle exactly; STEP's `RATIONAL_B_SPLINE_*` complex entities;
`tests/rational.rs`, `brep_oracle.rs`'s OCCT round trip); `Pcurve::Curve` written exactly; `Edge::tol` is
measured and `check` honours it, so it no longer proves pcurves meet edges: a reader holds
tolerances to a bar itself. `props::fluxes` tables a polynomial B-spline face's `G` per span (a
rational one's Gauss stretch by stretch) and **closes every
loop in the face's parameters** across the kernel's gaps (unclosed, the volume moved with the
origin). The mesher is a neighbour-array CDT, refined for sag **and** for a facet turning from the
surface's outward normal (signed); slivers get a point off the longest side; points nearer than
1e-9 are welded. `Mesh::turned` counts facets facing against their surface (thicker than bar/100);
the export refuses any.
**Phase 2 (the pattern ours):** `brep::pattern` turns a one-sector body into the whole (the
kernel's union is never made): sides matched by a pitch's turn, revolution faces keep the sector's
surface with pcurves shifted along `u`, pieces of one surface across a side become one face, a ring
keeps its last junction as seam. `Net::segment` cuts sheets exactly. `Built::mesh` meshes the
sector once (`mesh::mesh_with`) and shares seam points by index. Full verification reads our STEP
back by OCCT and measures it by `props` (1e-5; OCCT's volume held only to 1e-4).
**Phases 3–5 (the gear without OCCT):** `brep::sweep` builds an admitted swept body: blank from its
meridian region (`brep::planar`, `recipe::meridian`), cutters sectioned exactly (`brep::section`,
`planar::Chart`), sheets traced and fitted (`sweep::sheet`, `nurbs::interpolate_net`), blank split
(`boolean::split`), cells judged by the field (`sweep::sector`; else `sector::whole`), sector
patterned. `brep::export::{exact,step,stl}` is shared by `solventc` and `app/export-worker.ts`
(`gcs_solid_exact`), so native and wasm files are byte-identical: the core's trigonometry, `exp`,
`ln`, `pow`, `hypot` are its own (`fmath`, `x.dsin()` via `Det`; no platform libm). With OCCT and
`--verify-step full` the CLI reads our STEP back (`cad::read_back`). A face met twice is told apart
by `cutter::OCCURRENCE`; a trace ends off a sheet's patch (`Surface::off_patch`, a revolution's or
an extrusion's of a curve too); a revolution about the axis is kept by `pattern`'s turns; interpolations
past `nurbs::BANDED` points solve banded; a gross sheet falls back to chord length.
**Rung 3 (the app reads the exact solid):** a static solid's `EvaluatedSolid` is the B-rep's
(`solid::Exact`, `Sketch::exact_solid`, cached against `solid::reads`; `from_brep`), built about its
own origin (`cad::recipe_about`, every point written through `recipe::Writer`), faces named by document path (caps leading as the facet term's, so
edges are named alike), meshed no coarser than `BREP_RELATIVE_SAG` or 64 steps a turn, one
polyhedral `Prim`. The facet term answers what the exact path refuses (touching tori, empty
solids); `SOLVENT_SOLIDS=facets` throughout. Silhouettes on curved faces are traced on the surfaces
(`EvaluatedSolid::silhouettes`), never the mesh's seams, which zigzag.
Rung 2 is done: `Curve::BSpline` (`brep::nurbs`), `Surface::Extrusion`/`Revolution`, a face's
stretch of a traced or formula curve (`k from p to q`, `CurveE::trim`, `cad::FIT_MM`), lofts
(`Surface::Blend`, `Curve::Iso` rails, `step::FIT`) paired at equal parameter fractions.
`curve_surface` drops roots off the surface. The meter reads a static body by `accuracy::Exact` and
a field taking splines as chords within `CHORD_SLACK`. Edge sampling and `curve::tessellate` test
quarter points (a midpoint misses a cubic's S-bend).
Phase 0: `SOLVENT_ABI_TRACE=FILE` logs native entry points, Boolean face pairs
(`backend/probe.hpp`, `BOPDS_InterfFF`) and smallest pieces; `rust/gcs-cli/tools/abi_trace.py`.
