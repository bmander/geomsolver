# Analysis

Part of the [contract](../../CLAUDE.md) the code is held to. Read it when you touch
`interior.rs`, `KernelKey::Interior`, or `sparse::Ata::least_pivot`; or `model/scenario.rs`,
`syntax/scenario.rs`, `syntax/parser/scenario.rs`, `program/scenarios.rs`, or write a `scenario`;
or `model/material.rs`, a `material(…)` group (`flatten::values::material`), a solid's `of`, or a
material's JSON (`io::material_json`) or report (`report::materials_json`); or `eigen.rs`,
`sparse::Sym`, `sparse::Ldl` or `sparse::Pencil`; or `diagnose/analysis.rs`, `Structure::free`,
`Structure::reach`, `BodyFaces::whole` or a scenario's report (`report::scenarios_json`).
The epic these rules serve is #510 (design intent as structural performance), whose
prerequisites and stages (P1–P8, S0–S4) are named there; this file holds the rules landed so
far. The gate is `rust/gcs-core/tests/interior.rs` for the interior (P5),
`rust/gcs-core/tests/scenarios.rs` for scenarios (P4), `rust/gcs-core/tests/materials.rs` for
materials (P3), `rust/gcs-core/tests/linalg.rs` for the eigensolver (P2) and
`rust/gcs-core/tests/analysis_words.rs` for the diagnosis words (P7), unless a rule names
another.

- **An analysis output is a row, and its interior is a kernel** (#510 P5). A requirement whose
  value comes from `K(x)u = f`, `x` the drawing's numbers and `u` the displacements, is a kernel
  built at its block's widths (`KernelKey::Interior { n_par, n_const }`, `interior::kernel`) as a
  spline's length is (`integral.rs`): one row reading every number the structure is made of. It
  is not a boundary of `solve/through.rs`. A boundary's inner unknowns are parameters of the one
  `System`, and its inner solve is `newton::square` on a dense LU, its derivative a column at a
  time. A structure's displacements are thousands of numbers the drawing does not hold, its
  solve is linear, and it needs one derivative for many columns. As a row it is taken as every
  other row is, by the flat solve, the decomposition, the diagnosis, a claim and a free twin,
  and no boundary has to be named from Rust.

- **The value is one factorisation; the gradient is the adjoint** (#510 P5). `Structure::solve`
  assembles `K(x)`, factors it once and solves for `u`. `Structure::gradient` solves `Kᵀλ = ∂J/∂u`
  on the factor already in hand and returns `dJ/dx = ∂J/∂x − λᵀ(∂K/∂x·u − ∂f/∂x)`: one more
  solve, whatever number of columns the row reads. The gradient only reads the `State`
  (`Ata::resolve`), so it cannot factor again
  (`the_gradient_is_one_more_solve_whatever_the_columns`, to over 2,000 columns). `∂K/∂x·u` is
  never formed. Each element differentiates its own mutual energy `λₑᵀkₑ(xₑ)uₑ` in its own columns
  (`Bar::mutual`).

- **The stiffness is the Gram matrix of strain rows** (#510 P5). An element's stiffness is
  `Σ sᵣsᵣᵀ` over rows of its own degrees of freedom. A pin-jointed bar has one,
  `√(EA/L)·(−ĝ, ĝ)`. So `K = SᵀS`, ordered and factored by the normal equations the solver
  already has (`sparse::Ata`). A support holds a degree of freedom at zero by leaving its column
  out of `S`. A frame's or a continuum's element joins as more rows (a Cholesky factor of its
  constitutive matrix times its strain operator). A factorisation fit for 3D meshes is P1's.

- **A structure is its columns and its constants** (#510 P5). The columns are every node's
  coordinates (`dim` = 2 or 3 each), then every bar's area (`Structure::columns`), then the
  unknown where one sets the output. A held number is a column the system drops, as for any
  row, so a requirement can drive a node's place or a member's size. The constants are
  `[dim, nodes, bars]`, what the row states (`J₀`, or `(m, c)` with an unknown), every bar's
  `(a, b, E)`, then every degree of freedom's `(held, load, weight)`, written and read back
  exactly (`Structure::consts`, `Structure::read`, `a_structure_is_its_constants`). Whether an
  unknown sets the output is read off the row's width, as a spline length's is. The output is `J = Σ weight · u`, its weights a direction's
  cosines, so it is a displacement and the row is of **degree 1**. The residual is `J − J₀`, or
  `J − (m·a + c)` with an unknown.

- **A structure with no displacement to give is a failure, never a number** (#510 P5).
  `Failure::Free`: the supports leave a motion that costs no energy. The factor has an exactly
  zero pivot, or its least pivot as a fraction of its diagonal (`Ata::least_pivot`, recorded
  while the factor is made) is below
  `interior::SINGULAR` (1e-12, a few thousand times the precision). A node no bar reaches is
  one, and so is a node held only along a line of bars. `Failure::Collapsed` is a bar of no
  length, and `Failure::Unstiff` is a bar with `E·A ≤ 0`. The kernel reads every failure as NaN,
  in the residual and the Jacobian, which the step rejects and shrinks its trust region for
  (`a_structure_with_no_displacement_to_give_says_why`). `Structure::free` names the free motion
  (P7, below).

- **Held to closed forms and to its differences** (#510 P5). The apex of two bars sinks
  `P L³ / (2 E A h²)` to 1e-12, and its rates in the rise and in each area are the closed form's
  (`a_two_bar_truss_sinks_as_its_closed_form`). A bar in space stretches `P L / (E A)`
  (`a_bar_in_space_stretches_by_pl_over_ea`). Newton on the row alone finds the area that sinks
  the apex half a millimetre, to the closed form's (`a_requirement_drives_the_area`). The
  adjoint gradient agrees with central differences of the value. That holds for braced,
  redundant structures in the plane and in space, stated and free, and for two instances in one
  block (`tests/jacobians.rs`, `a_linear_interior_agrees_with_finite_differences`).

- **What P5 leaves to later stages.** No `CKind`, word or statement compiles to the kernel yet.
  Materials are P3 (below), and nothing reads one yet; scenarios and their requirement words are parsed and elaborated (P4,
  below) but compile no row; S0/S1 give the row its constraint type, with its callout or an
  `undrawn!` entry. Every call reads the structure from
  its constants and orders `K`'s pattern again (`Ata::new`'s symbolic analysis), though neither
  moves with `x`. The system also calls a kernel's residual and Jacobian separately, so a step
  that asks for both factors `K` twice. Holding the symbolic analysis per row (a hit on every
  step) and the factor between the two calls (a hit only at one `x`) are two caches, to be
  measured first and apart, as `solve/through.rs` measured its own. The element interface
  (strain rows and their derivatives, degrees of freedom apart from coordinates, several section
  columns) is S0's, shaped against the beam that needs it.

- **A scenario, parsed** (#510 P4, §9.11 [0.164]). `scenario NAME [: BASE] { … }` is
  `syntax::StmtKind::Scenario` (`syntax::Scenario`, its lines `Item`/`ItemKind`: a support, a load
  or a `RequirementText`), read by `parser/scenario.rs` alone. Its body is lines, not statements,
  each told by its first word (`Hold::parse`, `LoadKind::parse`, `claim`, `Output::parse` before
  `(`), so the words are contextual and only `scenario` is reserved (`words::OPENERS`). It stands
  at the top of a document or in its `preview` (`unannotated_chain_or_one` asks
  `at_document_top`, as a `param` does: anywhere else is a syntax error). A declaration in it is a
  syntax error ("adds no geometry"), and so is a load vector of two components. `print`'s
  `write_stmt` writes it back as written (`Scenario::write`), and `highlight` tints its words
  inside a scenario alone, as the parser reads them (`scenario_word`).

- **Read as the drawing's names** (#510 P4). The flattener writes the scope's numbers into every
  number (`Scenario::numbers_mut`, `substitute_in`) and rescopes every reference (`refs_mut` in
  `resolve::rewrite`): a scenario is a block like `when`, no prefix and no `PathStep`.
  `program::scenarios` reads each in `finish`, once every solid is built, into a
  `model::Scenario` (gcs-solve, pure data). Each target is read by `Resolver::operand`:
  `Applied::Ent` (a point, an edge, a face, a solid, `material`; `B.body` its solid) or
  `Applied::Face` (a face path, `FaceRef`), anything else **E040**, an unresolved name **E101**.
  A pressure is on a face alone (**E040**); `along:` names an axis or a line (**E040**). Each
  number is read by `flatten::value_read` against `Sketch::declared`, held to
  `LoadKind::dim`/`Output::dim` (**E103**) and refused where it reads an unknown (**E040**);
  `mode`'s count is a whole number from 1 (**E103**). Whether a face path names faces is not
  judged here: the analysis reads the solid's boundary after the solve, as a region reading a
  face does. Values are in the units the arithmetic is done in (`units.rs`).

- **Scoping, decided** (#510 P4). A scenario's name is its own namespace (**E001** twice),
  colliding with no geometry. `scenario B: A` begins with `A`'s supports and loads (copied, with
  the lines they were written on), then its own; requirements are never inherited; `A` is
  written above `B` (**E101**), so there is no cycle. A load combination is written out, no
  construct. A scenario adds no geometry of its own: a load patch is drawn in the body.
  `Elaborated::scenarios` holds each as a `program::Stated` beside the `Line` (statement, index)
  of every support, load and requirement, so a later report says it where it is written and
  survives `retext`.

- **A scenario solves nothing** (#510 P4). It states no row and makes no entity, parameter or
  unknown: the sketch, its JSON and its solve are the document's with every scenario deleted
  (`a_scenario_adds_nothing_to_the_drawing`). A requirement's grade (`Requirement::grade` over
  its `expr::Cmp`: `Claim`, `Driving`, `Bound`) is recorded, not acted on, but the rule S1–S3
  hold is kept now: one scenario's requirements drive dimensions, a driving row in a second
  **E106** until S4's optimiser. An edit removing what a scenario names never takes the scenario
  with it (`edit::remove::mentions`): the name left dangling is said (**E101**).

- **A material is a model value** (#510 P3, §6.9 [0.165]): `model::Material`, a name and the
  properties stated of it (`model::Property`: `E`, `nu`, `rho`, `yield`).  `Sketch::materials`
  holds the document's materials by absolute name (`steel`, `p.al` inside an instance), and
  `SolidE::material` names the one a solid is made of.  Nothing reads either yet.  The solve,
  the diagnosis and every evaluated solid are unchanged by a material.  `tests/materials.rs` is
  the gate.
- **A material is held in SI** (`Units::to_si`): pascals, and kilograms per cubic metre.  The
  same text states the same material in any document unit, inch or millimetre
  (`a_material_is_the_same_in_any_unit`).  The stored value is the value worked out
  (`7850kg / 1m^3` in millimetres comes back a hair under 7850).  Only a report rounds,
  `Property::text` to twelve figures.
- **`steel := material(E: …)` is a group with a material head** (`syntax::GroupDecl::material`).
  Its members are worked out as any group's, so `steel.E` reads as a number with its dimension.
  A material is handed to a component as a `group` formal.  `flatten::values::material` reads the
  members once they are worked out and checks each with `Property::read`.  A material whose
  properties all pass is stated in `Expansion::materials`.  One that fails any check is still
  a name a solid's `of` may give, but nothing more is said of that solid.  Every complaint is
  E103 at the property, or E001 for a property given twice:
  - a label that is no property;
  - a value of another dimension;
  - a bare number for a dimensioned property;
  - a value out of range;
  - a value that reads an unknown of the drawing;
  - a material stating nothing (E103 at the name).

  **A bare number is refused, not read in the document's unit.**  In a millimetre document the
  unit of pressure is a kilogram per millimetre-second², which no one means by `200000`.
  `Property::admits` holds the ranges: `E`, `rho` and `yield` are positive, and `nu` lies in
  (-1, 0.5).  The JSON reader holds the same ranges.
- **`of` names a material** (`syntax::Decl::material`, a trailer of `solid(…)`, reserved like
  `in`).  The flattener resolves it and judges it in `flatten::resolve::rewrite`, where it
  knows whether the name resolved.  `build_solid` only attaches a material that was stated.
  Each outcome:
  - a name that resolves to something that is no material is E103 (`` `rim` is no material``);
  - a material that was refused says nothing more;
  - a name of nothing is E101 alone, and one read through a name already said to be nothing
    says nothing.

  A group read whole is "handed on" for the W206 lint only inside an argument of a call
  (`program::drift`), so `of m` reads its group formal.

  The material belongs to the solid the document named.  When `Sketch::as_body` turns a cut
  solid into a body, the body keeps the material and the sweep moved to its stock carries none.
  A body's layers below its top carry none either.
- **A material is document state.**  `io::to_json` writes `materials`, but only when there is
  one: `[{name, E?, nu?, rho?, yield?}]` in SI.  `io::from_json` reads it back through
  `io::material_from_json`, which refuses a property no material has and a value no property
  takes.  The JSON holds no solids, so a solid's `of` is the source's to carry.  A rebuild
  (`graft`) copies the materials, and a paste brings those the document lacks.  `to_program`
  lifts each one as `material(…)`, written by `Property::source`, under a name a program can
  declare.  The printer writes `material(…)` and `of` back as written.
- **The surface:** `report::materials_json` gives each material's record with its `text` and the
  `solids` made of it.  `gcs_materials_json` exposes it over the ABI and `mesh.ts`'s `materials`
  exposes it to the page.  `report::material_text` is the CLI's line, `material steel: E 200GPa,
  …, of disc`.  `gcs-ffi/tests/materials.rs` checks the ABI and its JSON round trip.

- **A symmetric matrix is given by its entries** (#510 P2; `sparse::Sym`). `from_triplets` takes
  every entry of the matrix, both triangles, and sums the ones named twice, as an assembly adds
  element matrices into a global one; nothing is mirrored, so an entry given on one side only is
  not symmetric and is not a matrix the factor answers for.

- **One sparse factor** (#510 P2; `sparse::Ldl`). The up-looking LDLᵀ the normal equations use
  (`sparse::Ata`, its order RCM with any dense column last) is one `Factor` over a `Sym`, JᵀJ
  among them; nothing has a copy of it. Without pivoting: an SPD matrix factors stably, an
  indefinite one when no pivot is zero (`None` when one is), and **its negative pivots are its
  negative eigenvalues** (Sylvester), so `A − μB`'s count the pencil's eigenvalues below μ when B
  is positive definite. **A pencil is analysed once** (`sparse::Pencil`): `L − μR` on the union of
  the two patterns, ordered and its elimination tree built at construction, so each shift and each
  count is a numeric factor and no more. `sparse_ldl_solves_and_counts_negative_eigenvalues` holds
  the solve and the count against the reference on membranes shifted into their spectrum.

- **One iteration for every pencil `L x = λ R x`** (#510 P2; `eigen.rs`'s `solve`): shift-invert
  Lanczos on `T = (L − σR)⁻¹R`, self-adjoint in `xᵀBy` with B the side that is positive definite,
  its largest θ = 1/(λ − σ) the λ just above σ. Full reorthogonalization, thick restart (the
  wanted Ritz vectors kept), one factor for the whole solve. The tolerances are named once
  (`BREAKDOWN`, `FLOOR`, `GAP`, `SHIFT`), never written at a use.

- **The lowest pairs of `A x = λ B x`** (#510 P2; `eigen::lowest`; A symmetric, B positive
  definite, else `Refusal::NotDefinite`): `L = A`, `R = B`, the inner product R's. **The shift is
  found, not given**: `SHIFT` of the least diagonal ratio `A_ii/B_ii` below zero (a Rayleigh
  quotient, so no eigenvalue is above it), moved down until `A − σB` factors with no negative
  pivot, so nothing is below it and the nearest are the lowest; a stiffness free in a rigid-body
  motion has its mode at zero, found like any other.
  `lowest_modes_agree_with_the_dense_reference`,
  `lowest_modes_of_a_large_membrane_hold_their_properties`.

- **Linear buckling is the same iteration** (#510 P2; `eigen::buckling`). `(K + λ K_G) φ = 0` is
  `L = B = K`, `R = −K_G`, σ = 0, so `T = K⁻¹(−K_G)` and θ = 1/λ: K must be positive definite (a
  supported structure; a rigid-body motion is `NotDefinite`), no shift is needed, the largest θ
  are the lowest positive load factors, and a load that buckles nothing (a tension) has none. `L −
  μR = K + μK_G`'s negative pivots count the positive factors below μ.
  `buckling_finds_eulers_loads` holds a pinned and a cantilevered column to Euler's loads and to
  the reference; `buckling_refuses_what_has_no_load`.

- **No pair is missed** (#510 P2; rings and patterns give repeated pairs). A Krylov space holds
  one direction of each eigenspace, so after the iteration converges Sylvester's count is taken
  `GAP` above the highest value found; where the pencil has more below it than were found, the
  iteration runs again B-orthogonal to every pair found and finds the copies. The count answers,
  not the iteration. `a_free_ring_has_its_rigid_mode_and_every_pair`: the rigid turn at zero, and
  every mode twice, `4(k/m) sin²(πj/N)`, the tenth value cutting a pair.

- **What a solve returns is held to its properties** (#510 P2), not just to the reference: values
  ascending, vectors B-orthonormal (a mode `φᵀMφ = 1`, a buckling shape `φᵀKφ = 1`) and
  A-orthogonal with λ on the diagonal, each residual the pair's backward error `‖Lφ − λRφ‖ /
  ((‖L‖₁ + |λ|‖R‖₁)‖φ‖)` computed from the matrices (meaningful at zero, for a rigid mode), and
  Sylvester's count just below the top value equal to the number found below it
  (`assert_pencil_pairs`).

- **Deterministic** (#510 P2). The start and any fresh direction are draws of the seeded
  `rng::Rng` (`Opts::seed`), so a pencil has one answer. A pair converges when its Ritz residual
  is below `tol` (1e-10) of its θ, or of `FLOOR` of the largest for a θ near zero; out of
  restarts, or a count the deflated iteration cannot meet, is `Refusal::NoConvergence`, never an
  answer.

- **Dense pairs** (#510 P2; `linalg::sym_eigen`) are `sym_eigenvalues`'s Jacobi rotations,
  accumulated: the eigenvalues unchanged to the bit, and the vectors the iteration's Ritz vectors
  are made from.

- **Within the solver.** `interior.rs` and `eigen.rs` are in `gcs-solve` and know no Solvent.

- **What an analysis cannot answer is said in the solver's words** (#510 P7;
  `diagnose/analysis.rs`, in `gcs-solve`, knowing no Solvent). Four words, each read off what is
  already in hand — supports, a body's boundary, the pairs a solve returned, a row's value and
  gradient — and none off a mesh: the motions supports leave free, unbounded stress at an edge, a
  degenerate modal pair, and a requirement out of reach. A word is a report, never a row: it
  changes no solve and no count.

- **A rigid-body motion is named from the supports, never from a factor** (`analysis::freedoms`).
  P1's Cholesky refuses only a pivot lost to rounding and P5's interior a least pivot under
  `SINGULAR`, and no pivot ratio tells a free body from a slender held one, so the motion is read
  off the supports. Each `Held` support holds its points along one direction or every one, and a
  `fixed` support (`turn`) the body's turn too. The free twists `(v, ω)` are the null space of
  `e·(v + ω×(p − c)) = 0` over every held point and direction, `c` the supports' middle and ω's
  columns scaled by the supports' size so every column is a velocity (`RIGID`, 1e-9, the rank's
  cut). The slides are the free twists that do not turn. Each turn is about its axis through the
  point of it nearest `c`, its velocity there along the axis the pitch: zero for a turn, else a
  screw. World axes are preferred where the freedoms hold them (`SNAP`), so a body free about z
  says `turn about z through (0, 0, 0)`. A twist that moves no point of the body (`body`: bars all
  on one line, turning about it) moves nothing and is no freedom. Every freedom moves no held point
  along a held direction, and `6 − rank` remain under generic holds, screws among them
  (`the_freedoms_are_what_the_supports_leave`,
  `a_rigid_body_motion_is_named_from_the_supports`).

- **A structure's free motion is named** (`Structure::free`, P5's `Failure::Free` said). The
  rigid motions are the supports': each held degree of freedom holds its node along its axis, and
  the nodes are the body. A mechanism is what is left of the motions no bar stretches (each bar's
  strain row, `ĝ·(u_b − u_a) = 0`) once the rigid motions' fields are taken out. Its nodes are
  those it moves. It is looked for by a dense null space up to `diagnose::NUMERIC_MAX` free
  degrees of freedom, and is `None` past it. `Free::text` says both: `free to turn about (-3, 0);
  a mechanism: nodes 1 and 2 move with no bar stretched`
  (`a_structure_names_what_leaves_it_free`).

- **Stress at a sharp re-entrant edge is unbounded, and is said rather than computed**
  (`analysis::reentrant`). A body's edges are read off the boundary the drawing finishes, its
  rounds made (`BodyFaces::whole`, where `BodyFaces::read` is the stratum a round reads). A
  concave corner where the material's angle (`BodyFaces::angle`) passes a half turn (`STRAIGHT`)
  is one, once per pair of faces at its sharpest. Stress grows toward it as `r^(λ−1)`, λ
  Williams' least exponent for a traction-free wedge in its opening mode (`analysis::williams`:
  the least positive root of `sin(λα) + λ sin α = 0`; ½ at a crack, 0.5445 at three quarters of
  a turn, 1 at a half turn or less). So a stress requirement there has no answer a finer mesh
  converges to. A rounded edge's faces meet tangent, and it is no corner
  (`williams_exponent_is_the_wedges_least_root`).

- **A degenerate modal pair is named, and the ring that makes it one** (`analysis::repeated`,
  `Repeated::wave`). A run of a solve's ascending values within `eigen::GAP` of each other (the
  gap Sylvester's count already reads as one value) is repeated. A run at rest (`AT_REST` of the
  largest) is a rigid motion's, the supports' word, and is left out. An eigenvalue of two vectors
  has no derivative there (`φᵀ(L' − λR')φ` is no longer one number), so a requirement reads the
  run whole. Given one step of a ring of `order` as a map of the freedoms and the inner product
  the pair is orthonormal in, the step acts on the pair as `A = ΦᵀBTΦ`. A ring's pair turns by
  `2πk/order` under it, and `k` is its wave. A step that keeps each mode (or a reflection) gives
  none: degenerate, but not the ring's (`a_degenerate_pair_is_named_with_its_ring`, the free ring
  of 120: pairs 1–4 at waves 1–4, the cut tenth value no pair).

- **A requirement out of reach of what drives it** (`analysis::reach`; `Structure::reach` for the
  interior's row). A row that holds (`SOLVED`, 1e-8 of its size) is `Reached`. One that does not
  is `Held` where no column it reads is free. It is `Extreme` where its change over the free
  columns, each moved by its own scale, is below `STATIONARY` (1e-6) of its value. A solve that
  stopped there stopped at the extreme of what the row can be, short of what it states: the least
  it reaches where it states less, else the most. Otherwise it `Moves`, and there is no verdict.
  The interior moves a coordinate by the structure's extent and an area by itself. Driving two
  bars' rise to half their least sink, a damped Newton stops at `h = √2 w`, and the verdict is
  the closed form's `3√3 P w / (4EA)` (`a_requirement_out_of_reach_says_so`).

- **A scenario's words, at the solved drawing** (`analysis::scenario_words`). Its supports'
  points come from what each names: a point; a line's ends; a solid's box (a solid spans space);
  or every face a path names, by its edges' ends and quarters. They are held as one body until
  an analysis joins bodies of its own (S0), and named by the solids the scenario names:
  `scenario `lift` leaves `plate` free to turn about x through (0, 0, 0), …`. Every `safety`
  requirement on a solid with a re-entrant edge is said to have no answer. A support that cannot
  be read is said (`` `plate.nowhere` names no face of `plate` ``), never taken as holding
  nothing (`a_scenario_says_what_leaves_it_free_and_where_stress_is_unbounded`,
  `a_support_on_no_face_is_said`). `solventc` prints each word under the document's result once
  it is solved, and `--json` gives them as `scenarios` (`report::scenarios_json`,
  `gcs-cli/tests/cli.rs`'s `a_scenarios_words_are_said`). They are words, not errors: the
  document still exits 0.

- **What P7 leaves to later stages.** No word yet reads an analysis's own results: the degenerate
  pair and the out-of-reach verdict are said of pairs and rows a caller hands them, and no
  scenario computes modes or compiles a driving row until S0–S3. The ring a pair is the ring's is
  given as a map of the freedoms; reading it off a drawing's `ring` is the modal stage's. The
  free motion of a scenario holds its supports as one body: which bodies a load path joins is
  S0's. A pinned face is read as its points held, which holds a turn as a clamp does.
